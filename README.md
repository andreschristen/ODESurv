# ODESurv
Python programs for survival analysis using ODEs 

Go to Surv.py to run the examples in Christen and Rubio (2023).  It is properly comment so you may run your own examples.

The Logistic, Hazard-Treatment and the harmonic (not in the paper) hazard functions, along with their pdf, cdf and inverse cdf and simulation
functions are included in separate programs.  The data analysis is done with derived classes of Surv.  See the SurvLogistic and SurvHazardTreatment
in Surv.py.

The examples are run after if __name__ == "__main__":
